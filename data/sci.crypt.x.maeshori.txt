number serve entering cryptanalysis say compression encryption inherently bad idea done carefully means need strong encryption compression encryption silly unbreakable cipher yes pad unbreakable see part unfortunately pad requires secure distribution much key material plaintext course cryptosystem need utterly unbreakable useful rather needs strong enough resist attacks likely enemies whatever length time data protects expected remain valid random mean cryptography cryptographic applications demand much number generator applications source bits random must impossible predict nth random bit given complete knowledge algorithm hardware generating stream sequence bits lifetime source software generator also known function expanding truly random seed longer string apparently random bits seed must large enough guessed opponent ideally also truly random perhaps generated hardware random number source sparcstation workstations could example generate random numbers using audio input device source entropy connecting anything example cat compress foo gives file high entropy random much encrypt file using part key example convert seed entropy string looking hardware devices provide entropy important really measure entropy rather assume looks complicated human must random example disk operation completion times sound might many people spinning disk much clock output completion times relatively low entropy point distance see distance amount ciphertext sum real information entropy corresponding source text encryption key number ciphertext bits used significantly longer shown probably unique used back claim validity cryptanalysis significantly shorter likely multiple equally valid therefore gain security opponent difficulty choosing correct distance statistical measures make predictions rather gives results namely minimum amount ciphertext likely single plaintext corresponding ciphertext possible keys tried decryption working normally deal distance instead directly determine likelihood events interest let distance cipher characters fewer ciphertext characters enough information distinguish real key set possible keys des distance characters less ciphertext blocks block ascii characters may seem low first distance gives indication computational work required find key approximately characters fact actual cryptanalysis seldom proceeds along lines used discussing distance measures key size distance something guarantees small guarantee security high practical cryptosystems absolutely analysis manner characteristics might serve entering crack cipher messages
