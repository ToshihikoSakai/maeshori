israel said descendants course since rachel lived dies hebrews even egyptian interesting note rachel land jesus bethlehem anyone children rachel bethlehem buried north city way bethlehem rather unlikely event actually occurred never knows event mentioned anywhere else bible mentioned secular records time particularly reign many far less evil deeds carefully recorded might prime example events added jesus life enhance message church gospel whole story similarity tale infant moses egypt highly likely device set matthew add prophetic yet artificial approval jesus surprising matthew

servant people see matthew attempt prophecy examined three days three nights come upon prophecy supposedly mouth god jesus speaks crucifixion resurrection mt three days three nights son man heart earth three days three nights discussion occur necessary know jews understood days far day names went hours long lasting sunset following sunset referred day period light ending sunset thus according time scale sabbath day began friday evening lasted saturday evening jews celebrate sabbath daylight portion instead seems real miracle christians forget saturday indeed seventh last day week thus days nights referred together hour daylight portions hour night periods spoken thus jesus says grave hell otherwise three days three nights good book tells us jesus crucified ninth hour friday afternoon put grave sometime jesus left grave rose dawn call sunday dawn sabbath means jesus using time grave friday night time sunday morning could also add little time friday since bible specific means using jewish time grave day two nights possibly couple hours day certainly problem jesus prediction absolutely way even able death involve three days three nights even using modern time measurements led suspect error another matthew little mistakes gospel writer put false words god mouth matter made prediction hearing understanding jesus tool habit speaking vast stories deeper meaning could found

prophet psalms ps open mouth parable utter dark old things heard known things fathers told us hide children tell coming generation glorious deeds lord pointed verses psalms really come prophet might also want know earlier copies matthew gospel even inserted isaiah name prophet apparently later caught error tried cover perhaps significant part matthew altered old testament scriptures jesus said earlier speaks understand psalms hidden speak things known fathers told us jesus deals things hidden since foundation world indeed jesus dealt lot secrecy confusion direct opposition psalms wonder matthew rewrite still matthew artificial prophecies fall flat face christians rarely look matthew prophecies things christianity beginning look bad excuses little faith mt see disciples able go around casting demons except case knowing people thought disease demons wonder disciples unable jesus perhaps reported saying enough faith seems strange demon special seems either true believer faith

gods including jesus always ancient writings protected skeptics sacred either dead sleeping hiding heaven people imminent return great miracles days long gone yet life goes tales stories miracles distant time distant place gods used reveal men old days jehovah silent theologians give various excuses get see god anymore lazy enough sinful plan put many demands appearance right faith willing

brought ride jerusalem mt took place spoken prophet saying tell daughter behold king coming humble mounted ass course passage quoted reads little differently lo king comes humble riding ass colt command peace nations much difference except involves animal matthew reads wording slightly differently thus jesus call colt adult ass matthew version get picture divine christ two could inevitably lead theological find account written earlier mark colt called brought jesus indeed fits verses properly shows us matthew attempt use prophetic verses excluding many respectable christians met noticed christ thought ridden situation often reversed nowadays entering jerusalem temple priests people calling jesus messiah jesus replied might expect matthew done mt read mouth thou brought perfect praise likely matthew made response since jesus never point little prophetic things since might expect quote error seems fit matthew track record quite well might ask jesus matthew read source reads psalms lord name whole world whose glory heavens infants founded still enemy passages hardly need comment perfect praise spoken psalm praise given messiah king jesus mentioned seems case matthew pen making convenient prophetic scripture said lord jesus said asked promised jewish descended jews agree king david jesus quoting psalms lord said lord sit right hand put enemies feet taken face value jesus denying necessity descent assumes opposition answer course christian answer agrees trying make hidden point reveal mystery divine nature believe christian interested matters investigation problems jesus time psalm thought messiah easy see david might refer messiah superior need look scriptures messiah see expected great king bringing jews times even better rule course jews listening good answer passage could indeed refer divine messiah christians worship problem lies meaning psalm error apparently several jews jesus time also made must remember various among jews often result different expectations jesus apparently audience thought messiah imminent interpreted psalms among others messianic problem psalm literally reads lord sit right hand make enemies sends forth mighty rule midst people offer freely day lead host holy mountains priest order forever word lord often christian bibles divinity lord hebrew word exists simply means lord generic term use used often scriptures refer kings merely address respect nothing text imply word refers either divinity supposed written david certain title psalm either psalm david psalm david seems fitting assume written court david covenant endorsement psalm written david unlikely talking messiah idea perfect king descended david present david age extensive tales david none include messiah many psalms show evidence written long david dead times put show favour david kingdom hold description psalm fit david well david promised rise power victory enemies successful judgement among nations achieved priesthood common righteous king enabled bless people fits blame problem matthew alone though artificial prophecy though use scripture rather questionable still event common gospels let matthew little easily time interesting note though matthew event earlier gospel mark tells tale jesus simply speaking crowd matthew pharisees became religious competition infant christianity target jesus question might expect matthew event ends pharisees power pen moses jesus together along leave gospel story matthew see john gospel gospel story john deserves special treatment seems far removed real events jesus career told even matthew moment look verse early church leaders founded religion jewish hopes messiah king artificial extension original promises made constructing history abraham moses wrote promise land jewish people accomplished eventually rule king david christians came along later decided claim fulfillment promise expanded promise preaching kingdom john speaking father abraham see day say glad nice tie approval jesus abraham abraham knew nothing jesus messiah anything christian tried failed find event old testament john little prophecy par course see john making old testament matthew many christians know faith many foundations fraud surprising still field told jesus jerusalem followers judas matthew mt throwing pieces silver temple judas chief priests taking silver said lawful us put treasury since blood money bought potter field bury strangers fulfilled spoken prophet jeremiah took thirty pieces silver price price set sons israel gave field lord directed prophecy utterly gross old testament scripture first matthew made mistake regarding name prophet verses matthew makes use wages thirty silver said cast treasury price paid took thirty silver cast treasury house first verses deal messiah deal shepherd likely priest chosen serve function people shortly send israel conflict another word treasury replaced king james scholars potter precisely made matthew quote fit better blatant error correct translation hebrew indeed treasury also makes perfect sense context whereas field totally unrelated whether intentional seems beyond speculation however given matthew track record finds hard resist notion intentional course matthew ample reason altering text thirty pieces silver match judas situation christians seem reader willing disregard matthew might another prophecy toss around however correct translation directly contradicts situation judas high priests high priests put money treasury worthless shepherd exactly opposite course average bible student prophecy presented matthew taken new testament face value matthew work convincing enough wine vinegar casting lots jesus led away crucified mt gave vinegar drink gall drink crucified divided among casting lots might fulfilled spoken prophet among upon cast lots first vinegar offered jesus actually common wine type roman soldiers regularly find right jesus dies soldiers give drink gall jn jesus said bowl vinegar stood put full vinegar held mouth received vinegar said finished matthew seems drawing passage prophets psalms ps looked pity none found none gave poison food lit put gall meat gave vinegar drink add punishment upon punishment may thee let book living course wine offered jesus done request drink indeed seem show pity psalm quoted david political military enemies messiah jesus surprising run problem see jesus psalm asks damnation whereas jesus gospels says lk jesus said father forgive know matthew attempt create prophecy gall bitter substance put jesus drink meat psalm prophecy vinegar faulty naturally ask casting lots brings psalm deserves discussion suffice say fact jesus clothes divided told great thing turns happened often days soon see perhaps least passage psalm applied jesus indeed bring interesting question quality jesus clothes man removed ownership clothes worthy casting lots raises psalm psalm attributed david condition attack enemies becomes song praise hope taken context parts seem fit jesus crucifixion quite well examine primary passages verse god god far helping far words oh god cry day answer night find rest jesus said cried first sentence cross suggests whole psalm really jesus rather king david course rest first fit nicely jesus execution jesus complaining whole supposed lamb led mute indeed jesus much even cross certainly cry day night cross man men see make faces heads committed cause let deliver seems fit jesus execution pretty well exception holy messiah called many bulls open widely lion yea dogs round company hands feet see bones divide among cast lost far away deliver soul sword life power dog save mouth lion soul horns wild bull seem quite convincing sure early christian fathers wrote prophecy thought unfortunately prophecy fatal flaw words really exist psalm correct hebrew translation yea dogs round company lion hands feet hebrew phrase lion rare verb form mean differ character word hebrew text literally lion makes sense context even fits animal imagery employed psalm writer convenience urge christian change word add needed yet artificial weight prophecy christian chosen correct translation eliminate psalm referring jesus absence say much honesty apart verse psalm lend jesus easily verse speaks saved sword rather cross naturally fits psalm true subject king david side note know pierce hands rather say much favour traditional thought resurrected jesus showing disciples facts bound religious beliefs matthew escapes time attempt draw many direct links psalm lord jesus psalm many others minds gospel writers compiled stories interpretations jesus life death much scriptures may contributed actually got written question serious christian theology easy see faithful fundamentalists events new testament might enhanced eager matthew less speculate simply investigate scriptural matters prophetic claims far said good things matthew reference looks lot crucifixion john gospel written years fact tells us jesus execution jn soldiers side came blood water things took place scripture fulfilled look course built passage taken blatantly context prophet tells us much nation israel split jerusalem go war zc give victory day seek destroy nations come jerusalem pour spirit compassion jerusalem look child john attempt make prophecy perhaps weaker matthew attempts matthew least usually passage john errors obvious blatant speak well gospel writers helps show prophetic aspects religion founded arrest jesus quickly executed claiming jewish according version gospel tale jesus gets executed along two thieves mk crucified two right left scripture fulfilled says mark trying link jesus passage isaiah servant nation israel passage messiah reads whole chapter isaiah surrounding chapters sees servant nation verses also servant gone past prediction come event servant thought criminal also happens fit description jesus passage really messiah still clear executing jesus two thieves fulfill prophecy isaiah jesus fulfill whole ministry considered throughout career locking onto single event rather poor way steal prophecy least case see mark could made better analogy general comparisons mark goes tell us crucified jesus also expected couple course later luke decides change things luke tells us lk criminals hanged messiah save us certainly fits mark tells people crucified jesus said save luke goes criminal first saying fear since sentence condemnation indeed receiving due reward deeds man done nothing wrong said jesus remember come kingdom jesus answered verily say today paradise little dialogue seems highly imagination bit see picture fellow criminal speech rather strange picture criminal goodness punishment suffering man apparently noble principle seem likely wonder amount created luke course luke also disagrees mark luke criminal jesus easy enough discount account made wish believe part error free words avenue open yet another example writer trying take old testament passage expand suit theology case creates problems seen end world mt comes perhaps extraordinary passages new testament found three gospel stories doubt whole theory christianity jesus mentions destruction jewish buildings disciples ask end world warning disciples tell us destruction sign coming close age jesus take care leads many come name saying christ hear wars rumours wars must take place end yet nation rise nation beginning deliver put death false prophets arise lead many end saved gospel preached throughout whole world testimony nations end come see spoken prophet daniel let flee mountains immediately days sun stars fall heaven appear sign son man heaven tribes earth see son man coming send angels gather elect learn lesson tree soon branch becomes puts forth leaves know summer near also see things know near gate truly say generation pass away things take place day hour knows angels son father therefore also must ready son man coming hour expect clear jesus thought world within least disciples tells although know exact day hour come thus must ready theologians wet pants panic find way holy error unfortunately jesus made explicit told disciples generation still around end particular prepare prepare swept away removing nature bible said phrase generation shall pass away really means race people pass away course word generation used many times refer exactly generation disciples interesting notion god decided learn greek learn well enough make clear quite obvious rest dialogue disciples least supposed live end world charge completely blown away looking apostles responses becomes clear rev peter john rev jesus meant exactly said end near years christians chapter matthew ignored meaning altogether years waited executed leader come back hearing wars rumours wars sure coming soon surely must must wait imagine tired must sitting around holy waiting right moment spring shortly crucifixion jesus died said three days three days three nights three periods time three eternal seconds three whatever decide makes less trouble seen resurrected divine radiance decided best interests new religion stick around therefore disappeared sight heaven story goes anyway seen many things attributed jesus people got around writing gospel stories jesus prophecy scripture seen though matter quite throughout church history christians held fast faith simple belief doctrinal objections could solved brute force faith kept away question question investigate never easiest way treat matters thus years prophecies cited new testament gone largely accepted things may well continue way time moment consider way doctrines christianity accepted used properly support wars persecution suppose prophecy christianity keep hold mt jesus think come bring peace earth come

however assuming moment existence god impossible still subtle reasons assuming god assume something exist always possible show assumption invalid finding single hand assume something exist thing question impossible showing assumption invalid may require exhaustive search possible places thing might found show exhaustive search often impossible problem largest prove exist therefore generally accepted must assume things exist unless evidence even theists follow rule time believe unicorns even though ca prove unicorns exist anywhere assume god exists make assumption probably tested make exhaustive search everywhere god might prove exist anywhere sceptical atheist assumes default god exist since assumption test strong atheism usually claim sort god exists instead generally restrict
