might want try adding lines probably need lines though entry used enable support memory managers needed use programs windows runs slowly get windows running chances system running much slower probably happen using version file congratulations appears winning solution lucky whether luck hold remains seen system running much slower almost definitely caused smartdrive according windows documentation microsoft technical note smartdrive double buffering required must use smartdrive enabled works really slows pc estimated slowed pc factor five consider unacceptable looked solutions unfortunately disable windows enhanced mode work might even destroy contents hard disk trying run windows following use drivers provide opinion unbelievable smartdrive caused either inefficient bug smartdrive use driver provides services stands virtual dma services standard supported windows allows disk controllers work windows hard disk countless times found following solutions none require using smartdrive note however getting occasional parity errors probably caused solutions might see following require smartdrive using kind disk cache utility strongly recommended makes windows run much much faster driver need aspi functions controlling cdrom tape drive two physical hard disks etc add driver file windows needs option driver must loaded low memory loaded high memory november driver could obtained adaptec bbs hopefully still need aspi functions driver version use drivers file enough driver also loaded high assuming dos thought crash system asked adaptec technical support said loading high fine long loaded low system using occasionally cause windows crash upon exiting windows additional result corrupted disk files corrupted crashes usually occurred making different program default windows shell reason may necessary absolutely idea necessary versions earlier note many people use without seem problems consider people lucky others sorts problems opinion best necessarily easiest solution upgrade driver longer needed unfortunately could get previous upgrades adaptec bbs driver available adaptec bbs far know three ways get copy buy new november adaptec ez scsi driver kit supposedly

hardware pc causing upgraded motherboard found solutions however parity errors occur disk small definite possibility parity errors example changing bus timing certain disk transfers might cause run various memory tests hours time tests found problems problem probably caused memory marginal timing requirements cause parity errors disk transfers memory tests find problems problems show disk however mentioning case hardware problem tape backup devices two possible problems using adaptec tape backup device colorado memory systems jumbo tape take long time tape drive constantly starts stops starts stops etc tape operations may encounter many tape errors problem might caused defective hardware however heard people similar problems mentioning case hardware problem tape take long time tape backup device may adjust adaptec bus timing best results using tape drive normally tape backup restore tape drive motor continuously running occasional pause however default bus timing adaptec may cause tape drive motor start stop start stop every seconds causes needless wear tape tape drive however note dirty tape head defective tape drive also cause make sure tape heads clean also causes tape backup restore take much much longer necessary problem tape backups use floppy dma transfer data memory tape drive adaptec uses dma transfer data memory hard disk floppy dma needs feed data tape drive certain rate tape drive fed data quickly enough floppy dma tape drive stops bit enough data eventually fed default bus timing adaptec really dma timing large example backup done data transferred hard disk memory memory tape default timing adaptec memory much much time spent transferring data hard disk memory enough time spent transferring data memory tape drive result tape drive constantly starts stops data fed quickly enough solution change adaptec bus timing default factory setting bus timing needs lowered done two ways use option example use bus timing means use following line file note space recourse try find program called difficult find reason adaptec reasons seem want widely distributed asked someone worked adaptec asked upload anywhere anonymous ftp access internet could try using archie hunt copy believe couple sites find copy run bus timing running without arguments bus timing back factory defaults note seems use use crashed system loaded could use however lower bus timing increase lower low hard disk throughput suddenly drop system feel slower works fine value may work fine may adjust little lowered bus timing tape backups run faster also experiment bus times options intentionally described unless know bad combinations cause parity errors worse memory refresh program called exists adaptec bbs unless upgraded since last checked archive containing batch file couple files batch file supposed allow set bus times others however tried running program system crashed time running check see conflict maybe old program works although docs say works tape operations many tape errors problem may may exist although existed system hardware problem particular could cause however heard people similar problems mentioning case hardware problem symptoms problem even cleaning tape head backing tape sector detected errors resulting tape backup tape backup works tape compare fails tape drive starts stops starts stops etc much often unlike problem tape take long time tape drive starts stops every seconds kind occurs every seconds plus tape backup devices programs central point backup cms jumbo software assuming cms jumbo tape drive tape drive plus many tape read errors although know causing problem discovered using different floppy controller months ago upgraded motherboard contained integrated floppy controller already floppy controller initially disabled motherboard floppy controller decided try disabling floppy controller using motherboard tape drive cms jumbo reliability increased dramatically plus suddenly able find use tape drive know caused hardware problem hand floppy drives worked great attached seems say nothing wrong hand tape drive work well attached floppy controller work attached different controller could indication hardware problem change floppy drive cables conceivable problem cables know cause really however similar problems might want consider trying new floppy controller sound cards many popular sound cards play record digitized sound typically done using dma tape drive dma adaptec dma conflict sound card dma unlike tape dma conflict usually parity error system crashes parity error message happens data transferred quickly sound card adaptec memory refresh occur quickly enough causes parity error usually getting parity error means hardware problem system case however parity error symptom bad hardware found parity errors typically occur recording digitized sound chances errors increase increase recording higher sampling rate recording stereo recording using instead tape drive solution solution lower adaptec bus timing see section tape drives information done note however may may solve problem may reduce probability parity error software used record digitized sound greatly affect problem software inefficient disk caches speed hard disk amount disk also affect miscellaneous info section contains miscellaneous hints tips rumors much merely information heard read verified believe
