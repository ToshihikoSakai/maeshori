pointers function call hard evidence someone tried position give try thanks eric danny db juan martin starting server joe english joe start lot clients whatever sleep second two launching changed script actually took time heavily loaded system without much core though sounds crazy confirmed works provided good explanation works start server takes huge amount time start accepting connections lot initialization done server starts process large number pages process running time fight server use cpu importantly memory put sleep give server chance get clients start similarly also lot initialization whenever client program starts toolkits registering widgets resources programs state databases forth activity typically memory intensive initialization done process reached steady state memory usage typically using pages using launching clients avoid fighting workstation limited resources definitely mileage may vary situation many variables considered available ram local swap space load average number users system clients starting etc currently situation sleep exec sleep exec sleep exec xterm sleep exec xterm sleep exec sleep exec sleep exec xterm sleep exec xterm even tried sleep exec sleep exec sleep exec sleep exec xterm sleep exec xterm idea last make sure xinit completely finished processing settled steady state sleep expired clients launched fairly comparable results stuck current setup simplicity probably experiment bit find setup suits fonts loading fonts takes time ram minimize number fonts applications use get speed increases time simple strategy choose small number fonts small large roman whatever suits configure clients least heavily used clients use fonts client programs start quicker font already loaded server also server resources since fewer fonts loaded server fbm joe english joe eg main xterm font also twm set use menus icons etc twm default font since normally use eliminated font server oliver jones oj keep fonts local workstation rather loading nfs make extensive use fonts use font server resources file keep file small saves ram saves server startup time joe english joe suggestion file try putting minimum number resources want available applications example true separate resources individual resource files example file set environment variable xuserfilesearchpath setenv xuserfilesearchpath frequently asked questions faq contains excellent explanation environment variables work ed xterm launches loads resources finds forth note clients follow xxxxx naming pattern check system directory often find proper name name personal resource files name documented xt specification pg thanks kevin michael urban urban mike long kevin willing mail setup files method personal resources following benefits easier maintain usable fewer resources stored server property side benefit server may start quicker since load resources applications process resources never sort resources find ones affect also application interested load additional file every time starts seem make much performance difference might consider huge modifying application resource database need application without xrdb xrdb default run file cpp resources split multiple resource files loaded individual client programs watch style comments file cpp stripped switched method distributed resource files spent several frustrating days trying figure clients finding resources xt provide error message encountered style comments resource files simply processing resource file loss handy color enough cause people dismiss method resource management may also run clients break rules example neither emacs xvt find resources anywhere starting client machine share files machine resources stored client find resources loading resources server guarantee clients always find resources casey casey possible compromise suggestion planning trying put resources heavily used clients eg xterm file use separate resources files method clients seldom use define display properly client programs often executed machine server situation rather setting display environment variable hostname hostname name workstation set display variable access optimized routines know server machine use shared memory method transferring requests thanks patrick see section man page explanation properly set display name think stock mit least data general hp libraries smart enough use local communication even display set specially rob jody jody sent xlib patch change stock use local communication even display properly set want get business trying patches elected include hopefully mit apply minor lines patch meantime want try email jody ed clients megabytes ram think carefully number programs running think also programs running example smaller clock program unfortunately really noticed programs advertise large us research spread word suggestions better alternatives standard clients eg xterm welcome ed received contradictory advice people subject client programs advocate use programs strictly xlib based since xt xaw toolkits rather large others warn us applications using may already loaded shared libraries case using example client program may

xterm current version bind keys xterm heard versions xvt feature found yet update march recently email conversations brian regarding xvt questions whether xvt really faster xterm instance xvt may initialize slightly faster compare scrolling speed try benchmark dd see program scroll faster also xterm may slightly larger ram requirements hard numbers anyone else shared libraries shared text segments mean xterm paging requirements major experiment ripped tek stuff xterm made little difference since never use never gets brought memory stand conflicting reports validity xvt xterm summary mileage may vary provide hard data see specifically much ram much swap needs relative speed suggested der mouse mouse available also terminal emulator major lack people anyway tuning client suggestions tune client programs work faster scott barman scott comes suggestion regarding motif text field widgets noticed data entry motif text field widgets getting slight response particularly initial field examining going found seems resource focus text field widget even text widget cursor every time cursor appears disappears widgets widget code making request server user stop setting

really ever uses since slow headers add bytes per packet encoding protocol rather optimized packing links compressed header slip variant slip bytes headers bytes still anything protocol modems compression help increase packet takes time uncompressed data typical serial interfaces plus compression assembly time protocol emerging standard links serial lines complete set option negotiation slip growing number people see combination serial line management header compression becoming common running normal protocols serial lines running raw wire still needs compression somewhere make usable xremote name protocol set products originally developed ncd protocol serial lines addition using low level transport mechanism similar xremote protocol sending previous using compress entire data stream work done either server running host terminal server several advantages compression outside modem compressing modems otherwise using going directly connected reduces overhead cutting number bytes cross serial interface addition effects reduces requiring modem buffer data waiting blocks compress low bandwidth consortium project working standard area ncd xerox using ncd xremote protocol stepping stone developing new protocol go beyond xremote adding caching information connection setup data large window properties font metrics etc efficient encoding protocol hope standard

unnecessary things move also lay windows manner reduce amount cpu power spent raising windows joe english joe found good font aka biggest font know use sun screen still get two column terminal windows display overlap font suggestions accepted server server make sure server proper match hardware monochrome monitor use monochrome server monochrome sun noticed much difference xsun colour server however pointed smaller therefore contribute less paging thanks michael salmon server compiled also make difference jeff law law us sun system compiled gcc version sun compiler expect get large server using bundled sunos compiler assume similar results occur used commercial compilers market locking server ram anyone tried hacking server locked ram get eg via call help performance inquiry topic pointers function call hard evidence someone tried position give try thanks eric danny db juan martin starting server joe english joe start lot clients whatever sleep second two launching changed script actually took time heavily loaded system without much core though sounds crazy confirmed works provided good explanation works start server takes huge amount time start accepting connections lot initialization done server starts process large number pages process running time fight server use cpu importantly memory put sleep give server chance get clients start similarly also lot initialization whenever client program starts toolkits registering widgets resources programs state databases forth activity typically memory intensive initialization done process reached steady state memory usage typically using pages using launching clients avoid fighting workstation limited resources definitely mileage may vary situation many variables considered available ram local swap space load average number users system clients starting etc currently situation sleep exec sleep exec sleep exec xterm sleep exec xterm sleep exec sleep exec sleep exec xterm sleep exec xterm even tried sleep exec sleep exec sleep exec sleep exec xterm sleep exec xterm idea last make sure xinit completely finished processing settled steady state sleep expired clients launched fairly comparable results stuck current setup simplicity probably experiment bit find setup suits fonts loading fonts takes time ram minimize number fonts applications use get speed increases time simple strategy choose small number fonts small large roman whatever suits configure clients least heavily used clients use fonts client programs start quicker font already loaded server also server resources since fewer fonts loaded server fbm joe english joe eg main xterm font also twm set use menus icons etc twm default font since normally use eliminated font server oliver jones oj keep fonts local workstation rather loading nfs make extensive use fonts use font server resources file keep file small saves ram saves server startup time joe english joe suggestion file try putting minimum number resources want available applications example true separate resources individual resource files example file set environment variable xuserfilesearchpath setenv xuserfilesearchpath frequently asked questions faq contains excellent explanation environment variables work ed xterm launches loads resources finds forth note clients follow xxxxx naming pattern check system directory often find proper name name personal resource files name documented xt specification pg thanks kevin michael urban urban mike long kevin willing mail setup files method personal resources following benefits easier maintain usable fewer resources stored server property side benefit server may start quicker since load resources applications process resources never sort resources find ones affect also application interested load additional file every time starts seem make much performance difference might consider huge modifying application resource database need application without xrdb xrdb default run file cpp resources split multiple resource files loaded individual client programs watch style comments file cpp stripped switched method distributed resource files spent several frustrating days trying figure clients finding resources xt provide error message encountered style comments resource files simply processing resource file loss handy color enough cause people dismiss method resource management may also run clients break rules example neither emacs xvt find resources anywhere starting client machine share files machine resources stored client find resources loading resources server guarantee clients always find resources casey casey possible compromise suggestion planning trying put resources heavily used clients eg xterm file use separate resources files method clients seldom use define display properly client programs often executed machine server situation rather setting display environment variable hostname hostname name workstation set display variable access optimized routines know server machine use shared memory method transferring requests thanks patrick see section man page explanation properly set display name think stock mit least data general hp libraries smart enough use local communication even display set specially rob jody jody sent xlib patch change stock use local communication even display properly set want get business trying patches elected include hopefully mit apply minor lines patch meantime want try email jody ed clients megabytes ram think carefully number programs running think also programs running example smaller clock program unfortunately really noticed programs advertise large us research spread word suggestions better alternatives standard clients eg xterm welcome ed received contradictory advice people subject client programs advocate use programs strictly xlib based since xt xaw toolkits rather large others warn us applications using may already loaded shared libraries case using example client program may actually amount ram consumed seems mix toolkits try use athena clients xview clients motif clients etc use dragging toolkit library know environment think carefully client programs work best together environment thanks rob duncan sinclair sinclair sinclair better clock suggested duncan sinclair sinclair available displays clock title bar program saves screen real estate suggested der mouse mouse available non extensively configurable made look much mit mostly purely changing resources course ultimate clock resources takes screen real estate hangs wall better terminal emulator readme file distributed xterm abandon hope ye enter undoubtedly ugly program distribution ugly maybe site still used suspect xterm used clients many sites better terminal emulator available see must use xterm try reducing number reduce memory usage oliver jones oj xvt suggested richard available need features xterm get hold xvt written save swap space xterm rather hog written partial xterm rename resources xvt xterm current version bind keys xterm heard versions xvt feature found yet update march recently email conversations brian regarding xvt questions whether xvt really faster xterm instance xvt may initialize slightly faster compare scrolling speed try benchmark dd see program scroll faster also xterm may slightly larger ram requirements hard numbers anyone else shared libraries shared text segments mean xterm paging requirements major experiment ripped tek stuff xterm made little difference since never use never gets brought memory stand conflicting reports validity xvt xterm summary mileage may vary provide hard data see specifically much ram much swap needs relative speed suggested der mouse mouse available also terminal emulator major lack people anyway tuning client suggestions tune client programs work faster scott barman scott comes suggestion regarding motif text field widgets noticed data entry motif text field widgets getting slight response particularly initial field examining going found seems resource focus text field widget even text widget cursor every time cursor appears disappears widgets widget code making request server user stop setting resource noticeable sparc make little difference slower system specific suggestion probably applied general lots areas consider heavily used clients minor turned thereby save server requests miscellaneous suggestions pretty pictures use large bitmaps gif etc root window backgrounds complicated root window bitmap slower server screen windows redraw etc take ram cpu power work sun sparc conscious performance issues ca comprehend see people sun running root window let someone else figure much ram occupied full screen root image colour workstation anything need screen real estate get

fast xset system default xset default xset programming thoughts joe english joe speed applications developing tons things stick motif programs set resources individual buttons labels lists et al use whatever resource manager widget stick fonts possible better yet use motif absolute pig create destroy widgets fly try avoid many problems buggy toolkits use line width servers makes huge difference compress collapse multiple expose events make difference fast application completely small remark heard using better malloc function greatly increase performance xt based applications since use malloc heavily suggested trying malloc find time yet tests small programs malloc free differences indeed noticeable somewhat times faster confirmation anyone ed andre beck unnecessary events people use fastest routines forget reset gc used cause event every cases puts load onto connection forces client run thousands requests gfx context switching also seen created heavily changed xt uses definitely
