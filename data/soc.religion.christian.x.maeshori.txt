specific keeping sabbath day states day saturday sabbath christian religions keep go church sunday frequently asked question every time arises causes months debate let see answer directly basically law given moses part specific jews us jews part covenant argument early christian history whether mosaic laws apply gentiles became christians see account debate acts main question circumcision keeping sabbath part well apostles concluded need become jews order become christians therefore rules circumcision apply us law known man revealed mount rom notes law sin exist eden sabbath kept revealed ex problem first covenant law promise god wanted perform lives people ignorance years slavery promised ever says new covenant based better promises rather away law god promised put laws minds write hearts including sabbath acts selective inclusion sabbath important jews circumcision attempt made away sabbath reaction even recorded acts confuse weekly sabbath ceremonial could occur time week part law ceremonial moral law gal israel stands god people time god gentiles says glory giving law service god promises belong israelites explanation paul makes clear born israel enough israel israel gal says ye christ ye abraham seed according promise christians abraham seed jews israelites physically criterion spiritually joint jesus based promise god made people israelites christians agree ot laws apply us part specific jews also expect see similarity things god expected jews things expects us god however several ways dealing days common approach separate ot commandments moral ceremonial ceremonial commandments apply jews part specific mosaic covenant laws circumcision moral laws apply everyone commands part moral law except commandment sabbath believe people take approach say specific requirement worship sabbath part ceremonial law general obligation worship regularly part general moral law thus christians free choose specific time worship people probably agree wrong sabbath commandment ceremonial part law ceremonial laws free choose time worship even follow day worship origins pagan sun worship rather give day god blessed exchange church leaders agree biblical foundation see sabbath radical approach generally connected john calvin reformed tradition says law whole longer binding instead entirely grace behavior guided solely love portions ot law still useful guidance properly speaking legally binding us practice people take position believe safe leave christians without moral may longer law sinners safe us go situations principles guide us good safe thus christians moral guidance things jesus teachings paul advice etc may precisely law serve much function largely content moral law previous analysis calvin deny fixed legal responsibility worship specific day say given human weakness discipline regular worship important care calvin says guide god says law means keep law section law trouble sabbath commandment god thought important enough say study word deeply note message longer condemnation law freed grace god cop pulls speeding court ask mercy judge throw book gives grace walk court saying go speeding grace grace drive within speed

jews lord day free christian worship reference find nt rev also differences laws regarding day many christians support blue laws secular law church law setting aside day causing people spend worship radical approach sees regulations return jewish sabbath appropriate free christian worship lord day prefer twist turn relying different arguments conflict rather obey simple request god loved enough die jesus died law could changed bother die order meet demands broken law need change law penalties law breaking means law sin follow demands ceremonial laws always sin make false gods violate god name break sabbath steal kill etc except disagree opinion weight placed next word god darius clear much needs said faq think paul comments day another rom probably needs said accept darius honor lord wish might equally accept days alike similarly best honor lord however clear think proof regular christian worship first day indicated responses passages cited difficulty passages actually something else look talking christian meetings neither explicitly says gathered every sunday worship get various pieces information nothing aimed answering question act describes christians participating jewish temple worship christian communion services homes obviously temple worship sabbath acts example christians participating unfortunately tell us day christians met houses acts despite confusion described acts occuring sunday see reason impose modern definitions days start biblical text clear meant wording implies normal meeting say gathered see paul gathered breaking bread paul talked upcoming travel explicit enough really convincing similarly cor says first day set aside money collection want believe gathered specially homes ca disprove obvious time congregation take offering normally gather worship expected homes reason mention specific day think obvious reading first day every week simply means every time gather worship think reason implications clear statements nt
