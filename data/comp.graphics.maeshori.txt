compression standards compressing types images worked committees named mpeg respectively jpeg meaning image get decompression quite identical originally put algorithm much compression known limitations human eye notably fact small color details perceived well small details thus jpeg intended compressing images looked humans plan images small errors introduced jpeg may problem even invisible eye useful property jpeg degree varied adjusting compression parameters means image maker trade file size output image quality make small files mind poor quality useful image archives making

thus using jpeg essentially give time order store transmit image cheaply worth noting network phone transmission involved time savings transferring shorter file much greater extra time decompress file let arithmetic reason jpeg gradually replace gif standard usenet posting format jpeg store full color information million colors instead less fewer colors display hardware may seem much advantage within couple years though gif look obsolete format today furthermore reasons detailed section jpeg far useful gif images among people widely varying color display hardware hence jpeg considerably

color quantization algorithm much impact final image quality errors introduced jpeg except lowest jpeg quality settings since jpeg format converting color jpeg image display hardware requires color quantization true color even feed gif jpeg comes colors thousands colors happens jpeg affects pixel little differently two pixels started identical colors probably come slightly different colors
